# Assignment 9

### CS 648 coursework
Practice with jQuery

#### Practice with jQuery Events Notes
In practice.html:
- HTML elements are labeled with text, such as Alert, Pair A, Link, and Text Field.
    - Problem 1 is associated with Alert button.
    - Problem 2 is associated with Bind button.
    - Problem 3 is associated with On button.
    - Problem 4 is associated with Pair A and Pair B buttons.
    - Problem 5 is associated with Div 1.
    - Problem 6 is associated with Div 2.
    - Problem 7 is associated with Link.
    - Problem 8 is associated with Div 3.
    - Problem 9 is associated with text input with placeholder "Text Field."
    - Problem 10 has the text "Form" and labels for the text input.  

#### Special Notes
- The form text input elements have ids because there was a warning.  
- In the submit handler, the default is prevented, so that the border color changes can be viewed.
- The email text box is type text, instead of type email, so that it is easier to
  test the color changes without an email address. It didn't explicitly ask for type email, so it is text type.
